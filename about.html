        <h3>What is ACMA?</h3>
        <p>The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) is the leading representative body for India's automotive components industry, comprising over 950 members and contributing more than 85% of the industry's total turnover. ACMA's mission is to drive growth, create jobs, and promote economic prosperity by supporting research and development to keep India at the forefront of global automotive manufacturing. The organization also plays a vital role in shaping policies and regulations that foster sustainable growth and inclusivity.        
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>India's automotive industry, a critical contributor to the nation's economy, accounts for 49% of the manufacturing GDP and 7.5% of the overall GDP, supporting approximately 38 million jobs. In FY 2023-24, the auto component industry grew to Rs. 6.14 lakh crore (USD 74.1 billion), driven by robust domestic demand, a strong aftermarket, and growth in exports. The sector saw an 8.9% increase in sales to domestic OEMs, significant growth in the EV manufacturing sector, and a trade surplus due to rising exports, particularly to North America and Europe.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>ACMA is instrumental in enhancing the industry's global competitiveness through initiatives like skills training, technology improvement, and international trade cooperation. The association engages in international trade fairs, sends trade delegations abroad, and partners with organizations across the globe to promote trade and information exchange. ACMA's efforts ensure that India's automotive industry remains competitive and continues to grow on the global stage.

        <h3>What is ACoE?</h3>
        <p>The ACMA Centre of Excellence (ACoE) SAKSHAM is a state-of-the-art training center set up by ACMA
            with a mandate to disseminate future technology know-how to the industry. With the increasing need of
            the auto component industry towards skilling the workforce, ACMA had this dream to establish such a
            center that can work as a catalyst to fulfill this need of the industry. This dream was realized with the
            establishment of this center in 2018.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The vision of ACMA’s Centre is to “Create a World-Class Learning, Skilling, and Training Infrastructure
            for the Indian Automotive Component Manufacturing Industry.” SAKSHAM aims to impart world-class
            learning in areas related to emerging technologies in the industry and train the workforce to take up the
            challenge of implementing such technologies.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p>The Centre is dedicated to the industry and provisioned to provide a conducive environment for
            experiential learning, support organizations in creating a motivated, well-trained, and competent
            workforce, and support the Indian Government's Skill India and Digital India initiatives through training
            and skilling programs. Additionally, it facilitates the creation of a Make in India brand for the
            manufacturing industry.</p>
            <br>
        <p>SAKSHAM, equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure, includes the latest technology to meet the
            requirements of imparting training on future technologies. There is a full-fledged team for the
            administration and handling of these training activities, guided by a steering committee comprising
            renowned industrialists. The steering committee is headed by the ACMA president.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p>Since its inception, ACoE has organized numerous training programs in both physical and digital
            formats. This includes residential physical programs organized at the center or other locations, short
            one-day physical training, online webinars, online certification courses, and one international study tour
            in Japan.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p>To bridge the industry-academia gap, SRM University collaborates closely with ACMA to ensure the

            sector. This holistic approach ensures that graduates are industry-ready and equipped with the skills
            necessary to drive innovation and growth in the automotive component manufacturing industry.
